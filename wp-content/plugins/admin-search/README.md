Admin Search can be extended by using filter hooks. The following filters are available:

* `admin_search_sources` to modify the search sources. The filter argument supplied is an array of sources, add, remove or modify sources
* `admin_search_posts_query` to modify the [`WP_Query`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/) arguments array for all searched post types. The filter argument supplied is an array of `WP_Query` arguments, add, remove or modify supported arguments
* `admin_search_{Post Type}_query` to modify the [`WP_Query`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/) arguments array for a specific post type. The filter argument supplied is an array of `WP_Query` arguments, add, remove or modify supported arguments. Replace _{Post Type}_ with the name of the post type to modify
* `admin_search_terms_query` to modify the [`get_terms`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_terms/) arguments array for all searched terms (taxonomies). The filter argument supplied is an array of `get_terms` arguments, add, remove or modify supported arguments
* `admin_search_{Term}_query` to modify the [`get_terms`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_terms/) arguments array for a specific term (taxonomy). The filter argument supplied is an array of `get_terms` arguments, add, remove or modify supported arguments. Replace _{Term}_ with the name of the term to modify
* `admin_search_comments_query` to modify the [`WP_Comment_Query`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_comment_query/) arguments array for all searched comments. The filter argument supplied is an array of `WP_Comment_Query` arguments, add, remove or modify supported arguments
* `admin_search_users_query` to modify the [`WP_User_Query`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/WP_User_Query/) arguments array for all searched users. The filter argument supplied is an array of `admin_search_users_query` arguments, add, remove or modify supported arguments

* `admin_search_pre_results` and `admin_search_post_results` to modify the results array before or after results are appended to the array. The filter argument supplied is an empty array for `admin_search_pre_results` or search results for a given query for `admin_search_post_results`, add, remove or modify result items
* `admin_search_fields` to modify the searchable fields array. The filter argument supplied is an array of searchable fields (`post_title`, `post_name`, `post_excerpt` and `post_content`)
* `admin_search_meta_queries` to add custom fields to the searchable fields array. The filter argument supplied is an empty array. Use this filter instead of `admin_search_fields` when adding custom fields

Examples:

Modify the query string before a search is initiated

	// Correct the spelling of dog when searching
	add_filter( 'admin_search_query', function( $query ) {
		if ( 'dog' === $query ) {
			$query = 'doggo';
		}

		return $query;
	} );

Modify the `WP_Query` parameters before a search is initiated

	// Exclude post with the ID 96
	add_filter( 'admin_search_posts_query', function( $query ) {
		$query['post__not_in'] = array( 96 );

		return $query;
	} );

Add a custom field to the searchable fields

	// Add the price custom field to the searchable fields
	add_filter( 'admin_search_meta_queries', function( $fields, $post_type ) {
		if ( 'post' === $post_type ) {
			$fields[] = 'price';
		}

		return $fields;
	}, 10, 2 );

Modify the search results after a search has initiated

	// Add custom results from external API
	add_filter( 'admin_search_post_results', function( $results, $q ) {
		$results[ 'custom' ][ 'post_type' ] => array(
			'name' => 'custom',
			'label' => 'Custom'
		);

		$json = file_get_contents( 'https://example.com?search=' . $q );
		$obj = json_decode( $json );

		foreach ( $obj as $item ) {
			$results[ 'custom' ][ 'posts' ][] = array(
				…
			);
		}

		return $results;
	}, 10, 2 );

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.0 =
* New Feature: Introducing search suggestions! Now, whenever you search using a term with 9 or more characters and it returns results, it will be added to a database. The more you search that term, the higher it will rank. When you start typing 3 or more characters into the search box, autocomplete will display if it matches a term in the database, hit the right arrow key to apply it. This feature is disabled by default, go to Settings > Admin Search to enable it
* A new setting to enable or disable auto searching has been added. Typically, search results start displaying as you type, you can now disable this and only show results by hitting the enter key
* Many UI updates and some improvements to the mobile interface
* Fixed issues with hotkey handling. Navigating the results with the up and down keys is improved, hitting the right arrow key and the enter key behave better depending on what is in focus
* The search input has been switched from a traditional HTML input field and form to a contenteditable div, this shouldn't affect most users but may affect OS or browser settings and extensions that alter the way inputs work. Testing is ongoing
* Added support for WP_Block post type
* Removed the user display as setting. Users will be displayed using their username from now on
* Reduced the default result count to 5. This can still be increased to show more results initially
* Disabled Ctrl + S and Cmmd + S keyboard shortcut due to conflicts with WordPress and browser functionality
